							<h1>Hey there!</h1>
							<p>I'm Razveen, a recent graduate from the University of Wollongong in Dubai (UOWD) as a 
								Computer Engineer. Over the course of my degree, I have honed skills in 
								C, C++, Java, IoT, MATLAB, DL, AI by creating various projects. 
								Some of these projects were recognized in the annual intra-university competition 
								held at my university. Feel free to browse and learn more about these projects 
								and to reach out if you are open to working in any code based projects or if you 
								think I can contribute as an engineer! </p>

									<h2>IoT based Parking System</h2>
									<p>This parking system utilized LED's, IR Sensors and an Arduino Microcontroller coded in C. 
										The system was connected to an IoT based application Blynk, allowing the user to know 
										which parking slot is empty in real-time. This project was awarded the 
										"Most Popular Choice" in the UOWD Innovation Fair in 2022.</p>

									<h2>AI-Based Dementia Glasses</h2>
									<p>This prototype involving constructing a wearable spectacles for dementia patients, 
										to aid them in their daily lives. Using the AlexNet CNN in MATLAB, the glasses would 
										take a video input and recognise the person infront of the user. 
										The person's name and their relation to the user would be displayed on the 
										glass of the frame to aid the user in recognizing their close ones, 
										which start of as an early side effect of dementia.</p>

										the merit of current meteor detection systems which are used in many space 
										research centers such as the SAASST, EXOSS, BRAMON, BOAM & UKMON. This was awarded as the 
										"Best Innovation" in the research category of the UOWD Innovation Fair in 2024.</p>
